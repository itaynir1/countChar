# countChar
This project is a simple C program designed to analyze the frequency of lowercase letters in a text file. It prompts the user to input a filename, then reads the file character by character, counting the occurrences of each lowercase letter. Once the file is processed, it displays the total appearances of each lowercase letter in the file.
